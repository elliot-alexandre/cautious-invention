# cautious-invention (WIP)

Trying to create a discord bot that can detect specific keyword from the audio stream of users in one channel. With the possibility to create actions or events when one of the keyword is received.

## Reference and documentation (reminder)

- Discord Documentation about receiving audio

  - https://v12.discordjs.guide/voice/receiving-audio.html#basic-usage

- Vosk-Api use a different approch of voice recognition without using the speech recognistion webkit.
